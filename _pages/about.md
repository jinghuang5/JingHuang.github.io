About Jing
======
I care deeply about the environment, and my work sits at the intersection of environmental economics, energy policy, and land use. I use econometric modeling and Cost–Benefit Analysis to uncover data-driven pathways that support climate resilience.


I received my PhD from Renmin University of China in 2024. As part of my doctoral journey, I spent a year at Duke University, where working closely with [Prof. Patino-Echeverri](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/daliapatinoecheverri/people/) broadened my research into the policy realm. This collaboration continued into my postdoctoral work at Duke and continues to shape my commitment to developing strategies that advance a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future.
