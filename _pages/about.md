About Jing
======
I'm a researcher in environmental economics and energy policy at School of Science, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. I use econometric modeling and cost-benefit analysis to develop data-driven decarbonization pathways, with focused expertise in residential energy and climate resilience.


I earned my PhD from Renmin University of China in 2024. During my doctoral studies, a China Scholarship Council fellowship took me to Duke University, where a pivotal collaboration with [Prof. Patino-Echeverri](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/daliapatinoecheverri/people/) added a critical policy dimension to my research. This partnership, which continued into my postdoctoral work at Duke, now fuels my ongoing mission to build strategies for a resilient and equitable future.
