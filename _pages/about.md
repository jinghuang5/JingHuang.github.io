About Jing
======
I'm a Lecturer in Environmental Economics at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. I am currently working with [Prof. Patino-Echeverri](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/daliapatinoecheverri/people/) from Duke and [Prof. Yang](https://faculty.dukekunshan.edu.cn/faculty_profiles/yanran-yang) from Duke Kunshan University. 


I received my PhD from the School of Public Administration and Policy, [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/cn/about/introduce.html), in June 2024. 
With degrees in Economics and Management, my research interests encompass land use, energy policy, and decarbonization. My projects focus on the technical, economic, and public acceptance feasibility of using waste heat to reduce energy demand from residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
